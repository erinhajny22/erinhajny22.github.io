            Cats that resemble todays felids first appeared in the early Pliocene Epoch (5.3 to 3.6 million years ago), and they have continued into present times with remarkably few changes. The original design of fang and claw, flexible backbone, muscular strength, and agility allowed felids to survive and adapt to the 
            changes brought by each new era. Adaptations have occurred with changes in prey, but the basic body type has stayed the same.cat, (Felis catus), domesticated member (felid) of the family Felidae. The family is generally divided between cats from the subfamily Pantherinae, which roar (including lions, tigers, and leopards), and cats from the subfamily Felinae, which purr instead (including cougars, bobcats, and domestic cats). 
            According to the latest research, purring likely stems from a special pad within the folds of a cats vocal cords, which adds an additional layer of fatty tissue that enables the folds to vibrate (purr) at low frequencies. 
            Domestic cats are characterized by retractable claws, powerful bodies, acute senses, long tails, and specialized teeth adapted for hunting prey.tabby, type of dark-striped coat colouring found in both wild and domestic cats. One of the most common coat colours, the tabby pattern dates back to domestic cats in ancient Egypt. It is a recognized colour variety in purebred cats and is frequently seen in cats of mixed ancestry.
            Tabby colouring is highly variable but, for show cats, should consist of the following dark markings: stripes and whorls on the face and cheeks; a pattern like butterfly wings across the shoulders; two rings around the chest; bands on the back and sides; and rings about the legs and tail. It is noteworthy that the ancestors of the other common household pet, the dog, were social animals that lived together in packs in which there was subordination to a leader, and, over time, the dog has readily transferred its allegiance from pack leader to human master. 
            The cat, however, has not yielded as readily to subjugation. Moreover, the bodies, abilities, and temperaments of dogs have changed radically in the more than 30,000 years since they were domesticated, while domestic cats are almost identical to their wild counterparts. Cats show little of the infantilization of facial features seen in dogs and have retained much of their independent nature. 
            In fact, the felid generally thought to be the closest ancestor of the domestic cat is a small wildcat native to the Middle East and Africa (Felis silvestris lybica) that is genetically virtually identical to domestics and readily interbreeds with them, so much so that, in some areas, the wildcat is in danger of ceasing to exist as a pure species. Consequently, cats have retained their independent nature and can thrive as predators in the wild today. This is why feral cats abound and why experts do not consider the cat to be a fully domesticated animal.</br></p>

        <p>They have the best camouflage. One possible reason so many cats have tabby coloring is because the markings camouflage so well in wooded areas. The gray and brown stripes blend in perfectly with trees and underbrush, giving these cats the best advantage when it comes to sneaking up on their prey.
            Most ginger tabby cats are male.
            All orange cats are tabbies, and most orange tabbies are male. This is because the gene responsible for ginger fur is located on the X chromosome. A female cat has two X chromosomes, so she must receive a copy of the “ginger” gene from both of her parents to be born with ginger fur. 
            If she has just one, shell have a calico coat. A male cat, however, only needs to receive the gene from his mother. Thats why around 80% of ginger cats are male, and just 20% are female.
            Tabbies have stripes long before theyre born. When researchers observe feline fetal cells under a microscope, they can actually see patterns of thick and thin embryonic skin cells that resemble fur markings they would have later in life.
            Tabbies come in different varieties.
            Tabby cats are distinguished by the “M” facial marking but come in a wide variety of colors and patterns. The most common is the mackerel tabby, named after its vertical stripes that might remind you of a fish skeleton thats been picked clean.
            The M is for “Meow.”
            Tabby cats have an “m” shaped marking on their forehead, giving them their classic furrowed brow expression. Many cultures have legends surrounding this distinct marking. In Egyptian lore, the “M” stands for “mau,” their word for “cat” which also describes the sound they make.
            Most cats are tabbies.
            “Tabby” is not actually a breed, but a type of coat pattern. An estimated 60% of domestic cats are tabbies. Many are Domestic Short Hair cats, but a tabby can also be a Bengal, a Maine Coon, Ragdoll, or any other breed thats known by the Cat Fanciers Association to come in the “tabby” pattern.

        <p>Two distinct gene loci, the agouti gene locus (two alleles) and the tabby locus (three alleles), and one modifier, spotted (two alleles), cause the four basic tabby patterns. The fifth pattern is emergent, being expressed by female cats with one black and one orange gene on each of their two X chromosomes, and is explained by Barr bodies and the genetics of sex-linked inheritance.[8][9]

            The agouti gene, with its two alleles, A and a,[15] controls whether or not the tabby pattern is expressed. The dominant A expresses the underlying tabby pattern, while the recessive non-agouti or "hyper-melanistic" allele, a, does not. Solid-color (black or blue) cats have the aa combination, hiding the tabby pattern, although sometimes a suggestion of the underlying pattern can be seen ("ghost striping"). This underlying pattern, whether classic, mackerel, ticked or spotted, is most easily distinguishable under bright light in the early stages of kittenhood and on the tail in adulthood.
            
            However, the agouti gene primarily controls the production of black pigment, so a cat with an O allele for orange color will still express the tabby pattern. As a result, both red cats and the patches of red on tortoiseshell cats will always show tabby patterning, though sometimes the stripes are muted—especially in cream and blue/cream cats due to the pigment dilution.</p>
